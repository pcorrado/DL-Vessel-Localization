# DL-Vessel-Localization
Deep Learning for automatic vessel measurement plane placement on 4D flow MRI images.

This directory contains the source code used to train and test the network.

The network is based on Jihong Ju's implementation of 3D ResNet (See https://github.com/JihongJu/keras-resnet3d.)

A demo of this code can be found at https://share.streamlit.io/pcorrado/dl-vessel-localization
